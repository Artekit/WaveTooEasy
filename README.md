WaveTooEasy it’s a polyphonic WAV player that can play up to 10 WAV files simultaneously, with very low latency. It requires no coding/programming at all and you can use it to easily add sound/music to your projects in no time. Props, cosplay, toys, basic musical instruments and every project or product out there capable of toggling a couple of pins is one step away from being able to play audio files.

WaveTooEasy doesn’t require an external microcontroller or an Arduino: it has 16 digital inputs that can be used to trigger audio playback, so any signal going from 0V to >2.7V is enough to play audio. Optionally you can play WAV files by sending commands using a serial port.

Please refer to the [WaveTooEasy manual](https://www.artekit.eu/doc/guides/wavetooeasy/) for detailed information about usage.
